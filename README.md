# hey, i'm stark

building tools for AI agents. code by day, lift by night.

## current work

**[@monarch-xyz](https://github.com/monarch-xyz)** — DeFi lending dashboard on Morpho Blue. helping lenders optimize yield without the complexity.

**[herald](https://github.com/starksama/herald)** — local bridge from ntfy.sh to localhost. lets AI agents receive real-time signals without exposing public endpoints. simple, no server required.

**[flare](https://github.com/monarch-xyz/flare)** — on-chain event watcher for DeFi. monitors whale movements, governance votes, liquidation risks. feeds into herald.

## what's next

working on a managed signal marketplace — discovery, routing, monetization for real-time data feeds. separate product, still designing.

## stack

rust when it matters, typescript when it doesn't. clean code or no code.
